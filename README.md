# Cosmos
Real Time Profit and Loss GUI Program for Financial Market Speculators and Investors
My name is Andrei W. I am an aspriring business owner and entrepreneur that is using code as 
a pathway to start and make great applications for personal and business use and to then 
distribute them through various business ventures. 
I am somewhat knowledgable in HTML and CSS but am branching out and have learned some Python.
However, for the application ideas I have that I want to make (including this one, Cosmos) I 
realized I needed something better for the job so I am turning my attention to learning other 
languages starting with Java.
